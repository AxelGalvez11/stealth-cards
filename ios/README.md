# Lucida for iPhone

A native SwiftUI app. Every screen is one of the design canvas's iPhone boards, drawn at the same sizes, and it uses
the same server as the web app (app.lucida.cards): the library comes from `/api/state`, every change goes through
`/api/action`, and signing in is the same 6-digit email code.

Open `Lucida.xcodeproj` in Xcode 26 and run it on an iPhone or a simulator (iOS 18 or later).

## What's shared with the canvas

`design/to-ios.mjs` copies what the app shares with the canvas into `Lucida/Design/Generated.swift`: the theme
colors, icons, gradient palettes, tag colors, the sign-in wall's cards, logos, and the canvas's sample data. Run it
after changing any of those:

    node design/to-ios.mjs

Deck gradients come from the deck's name the same way as on the web (`Mesh.gen`, a port of `design/generator.mjs`),
so a deck looks the same everywhere. The film grain is one tile (`Lucida/Resources/grain.png`, made by
`tools/grain`). Geist and Geist Mono ship with the app (SIL Open Font License).

## Design screens

A debug build opens any canvas board with the canvas's sample data (nothing is saved):

    xcrun simctl launch booted cards.lucida.app -board PhoneToday

Every iPhone board works, like `PhoneReviewFour`, `PhoneDeckSettings`, `PhoneQuizMatch`, `PhoneLibraryCards`, or `PhoneSignIn`
(add `Dark` to the name for its dark-mode twin).

## Testing with your own server

A debug build can use another copy of the server, like the one in `web/server.mjs` running on your Mac (it saves
to its own folder and needs no sign-in):

    STEALTH_DATA=/tmp/lucida-test/ PORT=3194 node web/server.mjs
    xcrun simctl launch booted cards.lucida.app -server http://127.0.0.1:3194 -open deck

`-open` goes straight to `deck`, `review`, `stats`, `connect`, `settings`, `learn`, `library`, or `cards` (the Library's All
cards). Give that server `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (and `OPENROUTER_BASE` pointing at a stand-in, for testing) to try Explain.
